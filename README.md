# replace-invalid-whitespace-on-save package

Ever saved a web page, loaded it in the browser only to find there's a weird whitespace somewhere that isn't valid?
Ever faced error messages like ```Call to undefined function ' var_dump()'```?

This package is a simple solution to your problem: upon saving, those invalid whitespaces are replaced with regular whitespaces.
It's as simple as that.
